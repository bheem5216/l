**1. Vision:**

A leader must possess a clear and compelling vision for the future. This vision acts as a guiding star, providing direction and purpose for the entire team.

A visionary leader can articulate this vision in a way that resonates with their team, inspiring them to strive for a shared goal.

**2. Integrity:**

Integrity is the cornerstone of leadership. It encompasses honesty, ethical behavior, and strong moral principles. A leader with integrity earns the trust and respect of their team, creating a foundation of transparency and accountability. Without integrity, a leader's credibility is undermined, making it difficult to inspire confidence and loyalty.
