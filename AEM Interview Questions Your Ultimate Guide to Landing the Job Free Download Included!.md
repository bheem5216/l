## Core Concepts & Architecture

These questions assess your fundamental understanding of AEM's architecture and core principles.

*   **What is Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)?**
    *   AEM is a comprehensive content management system (CMS) that allows organizations to create, manage, and deliver personalized digital experiences across various channels.  It's built on the Java-based Sling web framework and utilizes the OSGi component model.

*   **Explain the architecture of AEM.**
    *   AEM follows a repository-based architecture. The core components include:
        *   **Jackrabbit (Oak):** The content repository, storing all content, configurations, and code.
        *   **Sling:** The request processing framework, mapping requests to resources and rendering components.
        *   **OSGi (Apache Felix):** The dynamic module system, enabling modular development and deployment.
        *   **CRXDE Lite:**  The web-based IDE for developing and managing AEM components and configurations.

*   **What is the difference between CQ5 and AEM?**
    *   CQ5 was the earlier name for Adobe Experience Manager. Adobe rebranded CQ5 as AEM.  Essentially, they are the same product, but AEM represents later versions with significant enhancements and new features.

*   **What are the key benefits of using AEM?**
    *   Personalized digital experiences
    *   Centralized content management
    *   Scalability and reliability
    *   Integration with other Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions
    *   Modular and extensible architecture

*   **What is the role of Sling in AEM?**
    *   Sling is a REST-based web framework that handles request processing in AEM. It maps incoming requests to content resources based on the URL. It then uses scripts or servlets to render the content based on the resource type and selector. This is often referred to as "content-centric" approach.

## Content Authoring & Management

These questions focus on your experience with AEM's authoring interface and content management capabilities.

*   **How do you create and manage pages in AEM?**
    *   Pages are created using templates. Authors can create new pages using the "Sites" console.  They can then add and edit content using components, configure page properties, and manage versions.

*   **What are the different types of components in AEM?**
    *   **Foundation Components:**  Pre-built components provided by AEM.
    *   **Core Components:** Modern, best-practice components that Adobe recommends using for new projects.
    *   **Custom Components:** Components developed specifically for a project.

*   **Explain the purpose of templates in AEM.**
    *   Templates define the structure and initial content of a page. They specify which components can be used on a page and define the basic layout.  Templates are used to create new pages.

*   **What is the difference between a static template and an editable template?**
    *   **Static Templates:** Classic templates, defined by developers.  They are less flexible for content authors. Changes to static templates require code deployments.
    *   **Editable Templates:**  Newer, more flexible templates.  Authors with proper permissions can modify the structure and allowed components of editable templates.  They are managed through the template editor UI.

*   **How do you use the AEM Assets (DAM)?**
    *   AEM Assets is the Digital Asset Management (DAM) system within AEM.  It's used for storing, managing, and distributing digital assets like images, videos, and documents. Authors can upload assets to the DAM, add metadata, and use them in their content.

## Component Development

Component development is crucial for building custom UI elements in AEM.

*   **What is a component in AEM?**
    *   A component is a reusable UI element that renders a specific piece of content. Components are built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and are rendered by Sling.

*   **How do you create a custom component in AEM?**
    *   Components are typically created in the `/apps` directory.  You need to define the component's structure (HTL scripts, CSS, JavaScript), dialog (for authoring configurations), and sling:resourceType.

*   **What is HTL (Sightly)? Why is it preferred over JSP?**
    *   HTL (HTML Template Language) is the preferred templating language for AEM. It's more secure, readable, and maintainable than JSP. HTL encourages separation of concerns (logic and presentation) and helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

*   **Explain the use of `sling:resourceType` in a component.**
    *   The `sling:resourceType` property specifies the path to the component's definition in the repository. It tells Sling which script to use to render the component.

*   **How do you create a dialog for a component?**
    *   A dialog defines the configuration options that content authors can use to customize a component. Dialogs are created using XML and define the fields that will be displayed in the authoring interface.

## Template Development

Templates are the foundation of content pages in AEM.

*   **How do you create a template in AEM?**
    *   For **static templates**, you create them under `/apps/<your-project>/templates`.  They involve defining the `cq:template` node type and configuring the `structure` and `initial` content.
    *   For **editable templates**, you use the Template Editor UI under "Tools -> Templates."  You define the initial structure, allowed components, and policies.

*   **What is a policy in the context of editable templates?**
    *   Policies define the design properties for components in editable templates.  They control what styles are available to authors and other design-related configurations.

*   **How do you restrict the components that can be used on a page using templates?**
    *   For **static templates**, you would define the `allowedParents` and `allowedChildren` properties on the template and components, respectively.
    *   For **editable templates**, you configure the "Allowed Components" section in the template's structure or initial content policy.

*   **What is a page policy?**
    *   Page policies are associated with editable templates and control the behavior and design options for the page itself, such as allowed components in the layout container or default settings.

## OSGi & Sling

These technologies form the backbone of AEM.

*   **What is OSGi? Why is it important in AEM?**
    *   OSGi (Open Services Gateway Initiative) is a modular system for developing and deploying Java-based applications.  AEM uses OSGi to provide a dynamic and modular environment.  Each component and feature is packaged as an OSGi bundle, allowing for independent deployment, updates, and lifecycle management.

*   **What is a Sling Model?**
    *   Sling Models are Java classes that provide a way to adapt a Sling resource (like a page or component) into a Java object. This allows you to easily access and manipulate the data associated with the resource in your HTL scripts.

*   **What are Sling Servlets?**
    *   Sling Servlets are Java classes that handle HTTP requests in AEM. They are typically used for handling form submissions, processing data, or implementing custom API endpoints.

*   **How do you deploy an OSGi bundle to AEM?**
    *   OSGi bundles can be deployed through the AEM Web Console (http://localhost:4502/system/console/bundles), or by placing the bundle JAR file in the `crx-quickstart/install` directory.

*   **What is the purpose of the Sling Resource Resolver?**
    *   The Sling Resource Resolver is responsible for mapping incoming requests to content resources in the repository. It provides a consistent way to access resources regardless of their location or type.

## Workflow & DAM

These areas relate to content workflows and asset management.

*   **What is a workflow in AEM?**
    *   A workflow is a series of automated steps that define a process for managing content. Workflows can be used for content approval, translation, asset processing, and other tasks.

*   **How do you create a custom workflow in AEM?**
    *   Custom workflows are created using the AEM workflow editor.  You define the steps in the workflow, configure the participants, and define the conditions that control the flow of the workflow.

*   **What is the purpose of metadata in AEM Assets?**
    *   Metadata provides information about assets, such as the title, description, author, and keywords. Metadata helps users find and manage assets more effectively.

*   **How can you integrate AEM with an external DAM system?**
    *   AEM can be integrated with external DAM systems using connectors or custom integrations.  These integrations allow you to access and use assets from the external DAM system within AEM.

## Security

Security is paramount in AEM deployments.

*   **What are the key security considerations in AEM?**
    *   Protecting against cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
    *   Preventing cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks
    *   Managing user permissions and access control
    *   Securing the AEM infrastructure
    *   Validating user input

*   **How do you prevent XSS vulnerabilities in AEM?**
    *   Use HTL's context-aware output escaping. Avoid using `unsafe` context. Sanitize user input before storing it in the repository.

*   **What are the different types of user permissions in AEM?**
    *   Read, Write, Create, Delete, Modify, Replicate, and other permissions.

*   **How do you manage user access control in AEM?**
    *   User access control is managed through the AEM user administration interface. You can create users and groups, assign permissions to them, and control their access to different parts of the AEM system.

## Performance Optimization

Ensuring optimal AEM performance is critical.

*   **What are some common performance bottlenecks in AEM?**
    *   Inefficient queries
    *   Large images and assets
