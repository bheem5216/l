## What is AICC?

AICC stands for Aviation Industry Computer-Based Training Committee. While initially focused on the aviation industry, the AICC's work on developing standards for computer-based training (CBT) quickly gained traction across various sectors. The AICC developed guidelines and specifications for how e-learning content should be packaged, delivered, and tracked within an LMS.

Essentially, AICC is a *standard* that defines how e-learning courses communicate with a Learning Management System (LMS). It ensures that course content developed using one authoring tool can be delivered and tracked accurately across different LMS platforms that support the AICC standard.

## AICC LMS: The Foundation of Interoperable E-Learning

An AICC LMS is a learning management system that adheres to the AICC standard. This adherence allows it to seamlessly import, launch, and track AICC-compliant e-learning courses. This interoperability is a crucial advantage, as it eliminates the risk of vendor lock-in and allows organizations to choose the best LMS and course content for their specific needs, regardless of the vendor.

## Key Benefits of Using an AICC LMS

*   **Interoperability:** This is the cornerstone benefit. AICC ensures that your e-learning content is portable and can be used across different AICC-compliant LMS platforms. This prevents you from being tied to a specific vendor and gives you the flexibility to choose the best solutions for your organization.
*   **Standardization:** AICC provides a standardized way of delivering and tracking e-learning content. This standardization simplifies the process of managing your e-learning programs and ensures consistent reporting across different courses.
*   **Content Reusability:** By adhering to the AICC standard, you can reuse your existing e-learning content across multiple LMS platforms without requiring extensive modifications. This saves time and resources.
*   **Reduced Development Costs:** The interoperability offered by AICC can reduce development costs by allowing you to choose the most cost-effective authoring tools and LMS platforms.
*   **Simplified Implementation:** Implementing AICC-compliant content within an AICC LMS is generally straightforward, as the LMS is designed to handle the AICC communication protocol.
*   **Established Technology:** While newer standards have emerged, AICC has been around for a long time. This means that many authoring tools and LMS platforms already support it, ensuring a wide range of options.

## How AICC Communication Works

AICC communication relies on a series of HTTP requests between the course content and the LMS. The course content sends commands to the LMS, and the LMS responds with the requested information. This communication includes:

*   **Launching the Course:** The LMS initiates the course by sending the appropriate launch parameters to the course content.
*   **Tracking Progress:** The course content sends updates to the LMS regarding the learner's progress, such as the completion status, score, and time spent.
*   **Storing Data:** The LMS stores the learner's progress data, allowing them to resume the course later from where they left off.
*   **Exchanging Information:** The course and LMS can exchange other information, such as learner details and course configuration settings.

## Limitations of AICC

While AICC offers several benefits, it also has some limitations:

*   **Web Server Dependency:** AICC relies on HTTP requests, which means that both the course content and the LMS must be accessible via a web server. This can be a challenge in environments where internet access is limited or unreliable.
*   **Security Concerns:** The use of HTTP can raise security concerns, as the communication between the course and the LMS is not inherently encrypted. However, HTTPS can be used to mitigate these concerns.
*   **Limited Functionality:** Compared to newer standards like SCORM and xAPI (Tin Can API), AICC offers limited functionality in terms of tracking and reporting. For example, AICC does not support tracking informal learning activities or capturing data from mobile devices.
*   **Older Technology:** AICC is considered an older technology, and while still functional and widely supported, it is gradually being superseded by more modern standards.
*   **Lack of Mobile Support:** AICC was not designed with mobile learning in mind, and it can be challenging to deliver AICC-compliant content effectively on mobile devices.

## AICC vs. SCORM vs. xAPI (Tin Can API)

AICC, SCORM (Sharable Content Object Reference Model), and xAPI are all e-learning standards that define how course content communicates with an LMS. Here's a brief comparison:

| Feature        | AICC                                   | SCORM                                      | xAPI (Tin Can API)                       |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Technology    | Older, relies on HTTP requests        | More modern, uses XML metadata            | Modern, uses a more flexible data format |
| Interoperability | Good                                    | Good                                        | Excellent                                  |
| Tracking        | Basic, limited tracking capabilities      | Enhanced, more detailed tracking available | Extensive, can track almost anything      |
| Offline Support | Limited, requires web server access        | Limited, requires web server access         | Excellent, can track offline activities    |
| Mobile Support  | Poor                                    | Limited                                     | Excellent                                  |
| Complexity      | Simpler to implement                    | More complex than AICC                     | More complex than SCORM                    |
| Popularity     | Decreasing, being replaced by SCORM/xAPI | Still widely used                         | Increasing rapidly                         |

While AICC was an important stepping stone in the development of e-learning standards, SCORM offered significant improvements in terms of tracking and reporting. Now, xAPI (Tin Can API) offers even greater flexibility and allows for tracking a wider range of learning activities, including informal learning and mobile learning.

## Is AICC Still Relevant Today?

Despite the emergence of newer standards, AICC remains relevant in certain situations:

*   **Legacy Content:** Many organizations still have a large library of AICC-compliant e-learning content. These organizations may choose to continue using an AICC LMS to avoid the cost and effort of converting their existing content to a newer standard.
*   **Simple Tracking Requirements:** If your tracking requirements are relatively simple and you don't need to track informal learning or mobile learning activities, AICC may be sufficient.
*   **Cost Considerations:** AICC-compliant authoring tools and LMS platforms are often less expensive than those that support SCORM or xAPI. If cost is a major concern, AICC may be a viable option.

However, it's important to note that AICC is gradually being replaced by more modern standards like SCORM and xAPI. Organizations that are planning to develop new e-learning content should consider using one of these newer standards to ensure compatibility with future LMS platforms and to take advantage of the enhanced tracking and reporting capabilities they offer.
