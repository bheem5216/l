Kestrel is designed to be lightweight and high-performance, making it suitable for serving dynamic content.  It is typically used in production behind a reverse proxy like IIS, Nginx, or Apache, which handles SSL termination, load balancing, and other security features.

**5. Explain the concept of Middleware in ASP.NET Core.**

*   **Answer:** Middleware in ASP.NET Core is a series of components that are assembled into a pipeline to handle requests and responses. Each middleware component performs a specific task, such as authentication, authorization, logging, or serving static files. The order of middleware in the pipeline is crucial, as each component can modify the request or response before passing it to the next component.

## Diving Deeper: Key Technologies and Frameworks

Beyond the fundamentals, interviewers will assess your knowledge of specific technologies and frameworks within the .NET Core ecosystem.

**6. How does Dependency Injection (DI) work in ASP.NET Core and why is it important?**

*   **Answer:** ASP.NET Core has built-in support for dependency injection, a design pattern that promotes loose coupling between classes and their dependencies. The framework provides an `IServiceCollection` to register services and uses an `IServiceProvider` to resolve dependencies.  Benefits of DI include:

    *   **Testability:** Easier to mock and test components.
    *   **Maintainability:** Reduces dependencies, making code easier to maintain and modify.
    *   **Reusability:** Components can be easily reused in different contexts.
    *   **Flexibility:** Allows for easy swapping of implementations.

**7. What are the different scopes available for dependency injection in ASP.NET Core (e.g., Singleton, Scoped, Transient)? Explain their lifecycles.**

*   **Answer:**
    *   **Singleton:** A single instance of the service is created and shared across the entire application lifetime.
    *   **Scoped:** A new instance of the service is created for each scope (typically a web request).
    *   **Transient:** A new instance of the service is created every time it is requested.

**8. Explain the difference between Authentication and Authorization in ASP.NET Core.**

*   **Answer:**
    *   **Authentication:**  Verifies the identity of a user or service.  It answers the question: "Who are you?"  Common authentication methods include username/password, OAuth, and OpenID Connect.
    *   **Authorization:** Determines what a user or service is allowed to access. It answers the question: "What are you allowed to do?". Authorization is typically based on roles, claims, or policies.

**9. What are Claims in the context of ASP.NET Core Identity?**

*   **Answer:** Claims are key-value pairs that represent information about a user or service. They are used to store additional attributes beyond the basic identity information (e.g., name, email).  Claims can include roles, permissions, or any other relevant data. They are a fundamental part of claims-based authorization.

**10. How would you handle errors and exceptions in an ASP.NET Core application?**

*   **Answer:** Several techniques can be used:

    *   **Global Exception Handler Middleware:**  Create custom middleware to catch unhandled exceptions and log them or return a generic error response.
    *   **Exception Filters:** Use exception filters in MVC controllers to handle exceptions that occur within actions.
    *   **Try-Catch Blocks:**  Use `try-catch` blocks to handle exceptions in specific code blocks.
    *   **Logging:** Implement robust logging to capture detailed information about errors and exceptions.

**11. Explain the use of Razor Pages in ASP.NET Core. What are the advantages of using Razor Pages over traditional MVC?**

*   **Answer:** Razor Pages is a page-based programming model in ASP.NET Core that simplifies web development.  Each Razor Page consists of a Razor view (`.cshtml` file) and a corresponding page model class (`.cshtml.cs` file).  Advantages over traditional MVC include:

    *   **Simpler Structure:**  Razor Pages offer a more organized and self-contained structure, as the view and its associated logic are located in the same directory.
    *   **Reduced Boilerplate:**  Razor Pages require less code than traditional MVC controllers and actions.
    *   **Improved Testability:**  Page models are easier to test than MVC controllers.
    *   **Better for Single-Page Applications (SPAs):**  Razor Pages can be easily used with JavaScript frameworks for building SPAs.

**12. What are Tag Helpers in ASP.NET Core?**

*   **Answer:** Tag Helpers are HTML-friendly syntax extensions that allow server-side code to participate in rendering HTML elements in Razor views.  They provide a clean and concise way to generate HTML elements and reduce the need for inline C# code in Razor views.

**13. Explain the difference between `IActionResult` and `ActionResult<T>` in ASP.NET Core.**

*   **Answer:**
    *   `IActionResult`:  Is an interface that represents the result of an action method. It allows you to return various types of results, such as `ViewResult`, `JsonResult`, `RedirectResult`, etc.

    *   `ActionResult<T>`: Is a more specific return type that allows you to return either an `IActionResult` or a specific type `T`. This provides compile-time safety and improves code clarity. It helps to define the expected type of result.

**14. What is the purpose of the `ConfigureServices` and `Configure` methods in the `Startup.cs` file?**

*   **Answer:**
    *   `ConfigureServices`: This method is used to configure the application's services, such as dependency injection, adding MVC features, configuring authentication, etc. It is called by the runtime before the `Configure` method.
    *   `Configure`: This method is used to configure the HTTP request pipeline. It defines how the application responds to HTTP requests. It is where you add middleware components to the pipeline, such as routing, authentication, authorization, static file serving, etc.

**15. How do you handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in ASP.NET Core?**

*   **Answer:** CORS is a browser security feature that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page.  In ASP.NET Core, you can handle CORS using the `AddCors` method in the `ConfigureServices` method and the `UseCors` method in the `Configure` method.  You can configure CORS policies to allow specific origins, methods, and headers.
