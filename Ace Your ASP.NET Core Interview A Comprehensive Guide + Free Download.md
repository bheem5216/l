## Fundamental Concepts

These questions test your understanding of the core building blocks of ASP.NET Core.

1.  **What is ASP.NET Core?**

    ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance, open-source framework for building modern, cloud-based, internet-connected applications. It's a complete rewrite of ASP.NET 4.x, designed to be modular, lightweight, and optimized for performance.  Key benefits include cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux), dependency injection, a built-in configuration system, and a streamlined development experience.

2.  **What are the key differences between ASP.NET Core and ASP.NET?**

    *   **Cross-Platform:** ASP.NET Core is cross-platform, while ASP.NET is primarily Windows-based.
    *   **Modular Design:** ASP.NET Core is modular, allowing you to include only the components you need.
    *   **Dependency Injection:** ASP.NET Core has built-in dependency injection.
    *   **Configuration:** ASP.NET Core uses a flexible configuration system based on JSON, XML, or other sources.
    *   **Performance:** ASP.NET Core is generally faster and more efficient.
    *   **Hosting:** ASP.NET Core can be hosted on IIS, Kestrel (a cross-platform web server), or other web servers.

3.  **Explain the concept of middleware in ASP.NET Core.**

    Middleware is a pipeline of components that handle HTTP requests in ASP.NET Core. Each middleware component can inspect, modify, or terminate the request and response.  They are executed in the order they are configured in the `Configure` method of the `Startup` class. Examples include authentication middleware, logging middleware, and static file serving middleware.

4.  **What is the purpose of the `Startup.cs` file?**

    The `Startup.cs` file is the entry point for the ASP.NET Core application. It contains two important methods: `ConfigureServices` and `Configure`.

    *   `ConfigureServices`:  This method configures the services used by the application, such as dependency injection, MVC, and other services.
    *   `Configure`: This method configures the HTTP request pipeline, specifying the order in which middleware components are executed.

5.  **What is dependency injection (DI) and how is it used in ASP.NET Core?**

    Dependency injection is a design pattern where dependencies are provided to a class instead of the class creating them itself.  ASP.NET Core has built-in support for DI.  You register services in the `ConfigureServices` method, and then inject them into constructors of controllers, middleware, or other components.  This promotes loose coupling, testability, and maintainability.

6.  **Explain the different lifetime scopes for services registered in the DI container.**

    ASP.NET Core supports three main lifetime scopes:

    *   **Singleton:** A single instance of the service is created for the entire application lifetime.
    *   **Scoped:** A new instance of the service is created for each request.
    *   **Transient:** A new instance of the service is created every time it's requested.

7.  **What is the purpose of the `appsettings.json` file?**

    The `appsettings.json` file stores application configuration settings. These settings can be accessed through the `IConfiguration` interface in ASP.NET Core. You can have multiple `appsettings.json` files for different environments (e.g., `appsettings.Development.json`).

8.  **What is the role of the `Program.cs` file in ASP.NET Core 6+ (minimal APIs)?**

    In ASP.NET Core 6 and later, the `Program.cs` file uses a simplified structure with minimal hosting API.  It primarily configures the host, adds services to the dependency injection container, and defines the HTTP request pipeline. It often uses top-level statements, reducing boilerplate code.

## MVC and Web API

These questions focus on building web applications and APIs using ASP.NET Core MVC and Web API.

9.  **What is the difference between ASP.NET Core MVC and ASP.NET Core Web API?**

    *   **MVC (Model-View-Controller):** Primarily used for building web applications with a user interface. It returns views (HTML) to the client.
    *   **Web API:** Used for building RESTful services that return data (typically JSON or XML) to the client. It's designed for building APIs consumed by other applications.

    While there are differences, ASP.NET Core shares many components between MVC and Web API, blurring the lines somewhat. Both use controllers, routing, model binding, and validation.

10. **Explain the MVC architectural pattern.**

    The MVC pattern separates an application into three interconnected parts:

    *   **Model:** Represents the data and business logic of the application.
    *   **View:**  Displays the data to the user.  It's typically an HTML template that uses data from the model.
    *   **Controller:** Handles user input, updates the model, and selects the appropriate view to display.

11. **What are action results in ASP.NET Core MVC?  Give examples.**

    Action results are the return types of controller actions. They represent the result of an action and determine how the response is generated. Common examples include:

    *   `ViewResult`:  Renders a view.
    *   `JsonResult`:  Returns data in JSON format.
    *   `RedirectResult`:  Redirects the user to another URL.
    *   `OkResult`: Returns an HTTP 200 OK status code.
    *   `BadRequestResult`: Returns an HTTP 400 Bad Request status code.
    *   `NotFoundResult`: Returns an HTTP 404 Not Found status code.

12. **What is model binding in ASP.NET Core?**

    Model binding is the process of automatically mapping data from HTTP requests (e.g., query strings, form data, route parameters) to the parameters of controller actions or to properties of model classes.  It simplifies the process of retrieving data from requests and making it available to your application.

13. **How does model validation work in ASP.NET Core?**

    Model validation ensures that the data submitted by the user meets certain criteria. You can use data annotations (e.g., `[Required]`, `[StringLength]`, `[EmailAddress]`) in your model classes to define validation rules. ASP.NET Core automatically performs model validation when a model is bound to a controller action.  You can check the `ModelState.IsValid` property to determine if the model is valid.

14. **What are filters in ASP.NET Core MVC?  Give examples.**

    Filters are components that execute before or after specific stages in the request processing pipeline.  They provide a way to add cross-cutting concerns such as:

    *   **Authentication:** Verifying user identity.
    *   **Authorization:** Determining if a user has permission to access a resource.
    *   **Exception Handling:** Handling exceptions globally.
    *   **Resource Filtering:** Caching responses.
    *   **Action Filtering:** Modifying action parameters or results.

15. **What are the different HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?**

    *   **GET:** Retrieves data from the server.
    *   **POST:** Creates a new resource on the server.
    *   **PUT:** Updates an existing resource on the server. Replaces the entire resource.
    *   **PATCH:** Updates an existing resource on the server. Applies partial modifications.
    *   **DELETE:** Deletes a resource from the server.

16. **How do you handle errors and exceptions in ASP.NET Core Web API?**

    You can handle errors and exceptions in several ways:

    *   **Global Exception Handling Middleware:**  A central place to catch unhandled exceptions and return appropriate error responses.
    *   **Exception Filters:**  Handle exceptions for specific controllers or actions.
    *   **Try-Catch Blocks:**  Handle exceptions within individual methods.

    It's important to log exceptions for debugging and monitoring purposes and to return meaningful error messages to the client.

## Entity Framework Core

These questions cover working with databases using Entity Framework Core (EF Core).

17. **What is Entity Framework Core (EF Core)?**

    Entity Framework Core (EF Core) is a lightweight, extensible, open-source, and cross-platform version of Entity Framework. It's an object-relational mapper (ORM) that enables .NET developers to work with databases using .NET objects. EF Core eliminates the need to write most of the data access code.

18. **What is a DbContext in EF Core?**

    A `DbContext` is a class that represents a session with the database. It's responsible for managing the connection to the database, tracking changes to entities, and persisting those changes to the database.

19. **What are migrations in EF Core?**

    Migrations are a way to evolve the database schema over time. They allow you to create and apply changes to the database schema in a controlled and repeatable manner.  EF Core migrations track changes to your model and generate corresponding SQL scripts to update the database.

20. **How do you configure the database connection in EF Core?**

    You configure the database connection string in the `ConfigureServices` method of the `Startup.cs` file (or in `Program.cs` for minimal APIs).  You typically use the `AddDbContext` method to register the `DbContext` with the dependency injection container and specify the connection string.  The connection string is often read from the `appsettings.json` file.

21. **What are the different ways to query data using EF Core?**

    *   **LINQ to Entities:** Using LINQ queries to retrieve data from the database.  EF Core translates the LINQ queries into SQL.
    *   **Raw SQL Queries:** Executing raw SQL queries against the database. This provides more control but requires you to write SQL code.
    *   **Stored Procedures:** Calling stored procedures in the database.

22. **What is lazy loading and eager loading in EF Core?**

    *   **Lazy Loading:** Related entities are loaded only when they are accessed.  This can improve performance if you don't need all related entities immediately.  Requires enabling lazy loading in EF Core.
    *   **Eager Loading:** Related entities are loaded along with the main entity in a single query.  This can reduce the number of database round trips but may load more data than necessary.  Achieved using the `Include` method.

23. **What are the benefits of using an ORM like EF Core?**

    *   **Increased Productivity:**  Reduces the amount of code you need to write for data access.
    *   **Improved Maintainability:** Makes it easier to maintain and update your data access code.
    *   **Database Independence:**  Allows you to switch between different database systems with minimal code changes.
    *   **Type Safety:**  Provides type safety and compile-time checking for your data access code.

## Advanced Topics

These questions cover more advanced topics in ASP.NET Core.

24. **What is authentication and authorization in ASP.NET Core?**

    *   **Authentication:** Verifying the identity of a user.  This typically involves validating credentials (e.g., username and password) against a database or other authentication provider.
    *   **Authorization:** Determining if an authenticated user has permission to access a specific resource.  This is typically based on roles or claims.

25. **How do you implement authentication and authorization in ASP.NET Core?**

    ASP.NET Core provides a flexible authentication and authorization system.  You can use built-in authentication schemes like cookies, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), or OAuth 2.0, or you can create your own custom schemes.  Authorization can be implemented using policies, roles, or claims.

26. **What are SignalR and gRPC? How are they used in ASP.NET Core?**

    *   **SignalR:** A library that simplifies adding real-time web functionality to applications.  It enables bidirectional communication between the server and the client, allowing the server to push content to connected clients instantly.

    *   **gRPC:** A high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework that uses Protocol Buffers as its interface definition language.  It's used for building efficient and scalable microservices.

    Both SignalR and gRPC are supported in ASP.NET Core and can be used to build modern, responsive applications.

27. **What is Blazor? How does it differ from other client-side frameworks?**

    Blazor is a web framework for building interactive client-side web UI with .NET. Instead of JavaScript, Blazor lets you write client-side logic with C#. It supports two hosting models:

    *   **Blazor Server:** The Blazor app executes on the server, and UI updates are sent to the client over a SignalR connection.
    *   **Blazor WebAssembly:** The Blazor app runs directly in the browser using WebAssembly.

    The key difference from other client-side frameworks (like React, Angular, Vue.js) is that Blazor allows you to write client-side code in C# instead of JavaScript.

28. **How do you deploy an ASP.NET Core application?**

    ASP.NET Core applications can be deployed to various environments, including:

    *   **IIS (Internet Information Services):**  A web server on Windows.
    *   **Azure App Service:**  A platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering from Microsoft Azure.
    *   **Docker Containers:**  A portable and consistent way to deploy applications across different environments.
    *   **Linux Servers:**  Using Kestrel as a web server or reverse proxying with Nginx or Apache.

    Deployment typically involves publishing the application, configuring the web server, and deploying the necessary files.

29. **What are the advantages of using Docker with ASP.NET Core?**

    *   **Consistency:** Ensures that the application runs the same way in different environments (development, testing, production).
    *   **Isolation:** Isolates the application and its dependencies from other applications on the same server.
    *   **Scalability:** Makes it easier to scale the application by deploying multiple containers.
    *   **Portability:**  Allows you to easily move the application between different environments.

30. **Explain the concept of microservices architecture and how ASP.NET Core can be used to build microservices.**

    Microservices architecture is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services. ASP.NET Core is well-suited for building microservices due to its lightweight nature, cross-platform compatibility, and support for containerization.  Each microservice can be developed and deployed independently, allowing for greater flexibility and scalability.  Communication between microservices can be handled using APIs (e.g., RESTful APIs) or message queues.
