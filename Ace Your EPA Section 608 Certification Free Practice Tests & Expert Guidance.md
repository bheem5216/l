## What is EPA Section 608 Certification?

Section 608 of the Clean Air Act prohibits the intentional venting of ozone-depleting refrigerants and requires technicians who service, maintain, repair, or dispose of appliances containing these refrigerants to be certified.  This regulation aims to reduce the release of harmful substances into the atmosphere, contributing to the protection of the ozone layer and the mitigation of climate change.

The certification is broken down into four categories:

*   **Type I:**  For servicing small appliances containing 5 pounds or less of refrigerant (e.g., refrigerators, window air conditioners).
*   **Type II:** For servicing or disposing of high-pressure appliances (e.g., central air conditioning systems, heat pumps).
*   **Type III:**  For servicing or disposing of low-pressure appliances (e.g., chillers).
*   **Universal:**  Covers all three types (I, II, and III).  This is the most comprehensive certification.

## Why is EPA Section 608 Certification Important?

Holding an EPA Section 608 certification is more than just a piece of paper; it's a demonstration of your commitment to responsible refrigerant handling. Here's why it's so important:

*   **Legal Requirement:**  It's illegal to service or dispose of appliances containing refrigerants without the proper certification.  Violations can result in hefty fines.
*   **Environmental Protection:**  Proper handling of refrigerants prevents the release of ozone-depleting substances into the atmosphere, protecting the environment.
