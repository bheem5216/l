## Document-Based Question (DBQ) Mastery

The Document-Based Question (DBQ) is a critical component of the Global History Regents. It requires you to analyze a set of documents and construct an essay that answers a specific historical question. To master the DBQ, follow these steps:

1.  **Read the Historical Context:** Understand the background information provided before the documents. This provides context for interpreting the documents.
2.  **Analyze Each Document:** Carefully read each document and identify its main idea, point of view, and potential biases. Use SOAPSTone (Speaker, Occasion, Audience, Purpose, Subject, Tone) or similar strategies.
3.  **Group the Documents:** Organize the documents into logical groups based on common themes or arguments. This will help you structure your essay.
4.  **Develop a Thesis Statement:** Formulate a clear and concise thesis statement that directly answers the DBQ question and previews your main arguments.
5.  **Write a Well-Organized Essay:** Structure your essay with an introduction (including the thesis statement), body paragraphs (each addressing a specific group of documents), and a conclusion that summarizes your arguments.
6.  **Use Evidence from the Documents:** Support your arguments with specific evidence from the documents. Quote sparingly and paraphrase effectively.
7.  **Analyze the Documents:** Go beyond simply summarizing the documents. Explain the significance of the evidence and how it supports your arguments.
8.  **Consider Point of View and Bias:** Analyze the point of view of the documentâ€™s author and identify any potential biases that may affect its reliability.
9.  **Include Outside Information:** Incorporate your own knowledge of the historical period to provide context and strengthen your arguments.
10. **Practice, Practice, Practice:** The best way to improve your DBQ skills is to practice writing essays using past Regents exams.

## Thematic Essay Writing

The thematic essay requires you to write an essay on a given historical theme, drawing on your knowledge of global history. To excel on the thematic essay, follow these steps:

6.  **Analyze the Examples:** Explain how each example illustrates the theme and its significance in global history.
7.  **Connect Examples to the Theme:** Make clear connections between your examples and the overall theme. Show how the examples are related and contribute to a broader understanding of the theme.
