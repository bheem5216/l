3.  **Analyze Your Results:** After each practice exam, carefully review your results. Identify the questions you answered incorrectly and understand why you made those mistakes.

4.  **Focus on Weak Areas:** Dedicate extra study time to the areas where you consistently struggle on practice exams. Review the relevant documentation, watch videos, and seek help from online forums or study groups.

5.  **Track Your Progress:** Keep track of your scores on practice exams. This will help you monitor your progress and identify areas where you're improving.
