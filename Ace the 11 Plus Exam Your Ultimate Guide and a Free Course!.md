## What is the 11 Plus Exam?

The 11 plus exam is a selective entrance examination used in England and Northern Ireland to assess students' academic potential and determine their suitability for grammar schools or other selective secondary schools. It's typically taken in Year 6, when children are aged 10 or 11. The exam aims to identify students who are academically gifted and likely to thrive in a more challenging academic environment.
