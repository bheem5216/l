## What is Agile?

Agile is not a single methodology, but rather an umbrella term for a set of iterative and incremental approaches to project management and software development. It's based on the values and principles outlined in the Agile Manifesto, which emphasizes:

*   **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
*   **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
*   **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
*   **Responding to change** over following a plan

These values translate into a focus on:

*   **Collaboration:** Agile teams work closely together, with frequent communication and feedback loops.
*   **Iteration:** Projects are broken down into small, manageable increments, allowing for continuous improvement and adaptation.
*   **Customer Focus:** Customer feedback is actively sought and incorporated throughout the development process.
*   **Flexibility:** Agile methodologies are designed to be adaptable to changing requirements and priorities.
