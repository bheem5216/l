# Angular Router Navigate: Opening Links in New Tabs - A Comprehensive Guide (with Free Course!)

The Angular Router is a powerful tool for managing navigation within your single-page applications (SPAs). While typically used to navigate between different views within the same browser tab, you might encounter scenarios where you want to open a link in a new tab or window. This provides a way for users to explore related content without leaving the current page they're on. In this article, we'll explore various methods to achieve this, along with their pros and cons. As a bonus, I'm offering a **free course on mastering Angular Router functionalities, including advanced navigation techniques!**  Download it now: [Angular Router Deep Dive](https://udemywork.com/router-navigate-angular-new-tab).

## Understanding the Need for New Tab Navigation

Consider these use cases where opening a link in a new tab is beneficial:

*   **External Links:**  Linking to external websites.  You definitely want users to stay on your site while checking out the reference.
*   **Related Content:**  Providing links to related documentation or blog posts without interrupting the user's workflow.
*   **Complex Forms:**  Allowing users to open a separate page to fill out detailed information (like an address) without losing their progress on the main form.
*   **Admin Panels:**  Opening different sections of the admin panel in separate tabs for easier management.

## Methods for Opening Links in a New Tab

There are several ways to achieve this in Angular. We'll examine each approach, along with code examples and explanations.

### 1.  Using the `<a>` Tag with `target="_blank"`

This is the simplest and most straightforward method.  You simply use the standard HTML anchor tag (`<a>`) with the `target="_blank"` attribute.  This tells the browser to open the linked URL in a new tab or window.  The `rel="noopener noreferrer"` is crucial for security reasons (explained below).

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  Open Example Website in a New Tab
</a>
```

**Explanation:**

*   `href`:  The URL you want to navigate to.
*   `target="_blank"`: This attribute instructs the browser to open the link in a new tab or window.
*   `rel="noopener noreferrer"`: This attribute is extremely important for security.  When you open a link with `target="_blank"`, the new page gains partial access to the originating page through the `window.opener` property.  This can be a security vulnerability.  `rel="noopener"` prevents the new page from accessing the originating page's `window.opener`.  `rel="noreferrer"` also prevents the new page from knowing where the user came from (removes the referrer information), providing additional privacy.

**Advantages:**

*   Simple and easy to implement.
*   Requires minimal Angular code.
*   Works with any URL (internal or external).

**Disadvantages:**

*   Bypasses the Angular Router. Angular won't know about this navigation, so features like route guards and resolvers won't be triggered. This is usually fine for external links but can be problematic for internal links if you rely on the router's features.
*   Less control over the navigation process.

### 2.  Using `window.open()` in an Angular Component

You can programmatically open a new tab using the `window.open()` method within your Angular component.  This provides more control over the navigation process but requires more code.

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  template: `
    <button (click)="openNewTab()">Open New Tab</button>
  `,
})
export class MyComponent {
  openNewTab() {
    window.open('https://www.example.com', '_blank');
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   The `openNewTab()` method is called when the button is clicked.
*   `window.open('https://www.example.com', '_blank')` opens the specified URL in a new tab. The `_blank` argument is crucial; it tells `window.open()` to open the URL in a new tab or window.

**Advantages:**

*   More control over the navigation process compared to using the `<a>` tag directly.  You can perform actions before opening the tab (e.g., logging, data manipulation).
*   Can be used to open dynamic URLs.

**Disadvantages:**

*   Bypasses the Angular Router (similar to the `<a>` tag approach).
*   Requires more code than the `<a>` tag method.
*   Still needs the `rel="noopener noreferrer"` security consideration if the opened page interacts with the originating page (though harder to directly implement this). In most scenarios this is not a concern since it is a JavaScript method.

### 3.  Using the Angular Router with a "Detour" Component

This approach is more complex but allows you to leverage the Angular Router for internal links while still opening them in a new tab.  The idea is to create a temporary "detour" component that opens the new tab and then navigates back (or somewhere else).  This allows the router to process the navigation before the new tab is opened.

First, create the "detour" component:

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { Router, ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-new-tab-detour',
  template: '', // No visible template
})
export class NewTabDetourComponent implements OnInit {
  constructor(private router: Router, private route: ActivatedRoute) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.route.queryParams.subscribe(params => {
      const url = params['url']; // Get the URL from query parameters

      if (url) {
        window.open(url, '_blank'); // Open in a new tab
      }

      // Navigate back or to a different route
      this.router.navigate(['/']); // Navigate to the home page, for example
    });
  }
}
```

Now, define the route in your `app-routing.module.ts`:

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { NewTabDetourComponent } from './new-tab-detour.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  // ... other routes
  { path: 'new-tab-detour', component: NewTabDetourComponent },
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule],
})
export class AppRoutingModule {}
```

Finally, link to this "detour" route:

```html
<a [routerLink]="['/new-tab-detour']" [queryParams]="{ url: '/some-internal-route' }">
  Open Internal Route in New Tab
</a>
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Detour Component:** The `NewTabDetourComponent` takes the URL as a query parameter.  It opens the URL in a new tab using `window.open()` and then navigates back to the original page (or any other route you choose).
2.  **Route Definition:**  The route `/new-tab-detour` is defined to point to the `NewTabDetourComponent`.
3.  **Router Link:** The `routerLink` uses the `queryParams` to pass the desired URL to the detour component.  This ensures that the Angular Router handles the navigation before the new tab is opened.

**Advantages:**

*   Leverages the Angular Router for internal links.
*   Allows route guards and resolvers to be executed before the new tab is opened.
*   Maintains a cleaner separation of concerns.

**Disadvantages:**

*   More complex to implement than the other methods.
*   Requires creating a dedicated component for handling new tab navigation.

### 4.  Using a Custom Router Link Directive

You can create a custom Angular directive that extends the `RouterLink` directive to automatically add the `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attributes to any link using the directive.

```typescript
import { Directive, HostListener, HostBinding, Input } from '@angular/core';
import { Router, NavigationExtras } from '@angular/router';

@Directive({
  selector: '[appNewTabRouterLink]',
})
export class NewTabRouterLinkDirective {
  @Input('appNewTabRouterLink') linkParams: any[] | string | undefined;
  @Input() queryParams: NavigationExtras['queryParams'] | undefined;
  @HostBinding('attr.target') target: string | null = '_blank';
  @HostBinding('attr.rel') rel: string = 'noopener noreferrer';

  constructor(private router: Router) {}

  @HostListener('click', ['$event'])
  onClick(event: MouseEvent): void {
    if (event.metaKey || event.ctrlKey || event.shiftKey || event.button === 1) {
      return; // Let the browser handle Cmd/Ctrl+click and middle-click
    }

    event.preventDefault(); // Prevent default navigation

    if (typeof this.linkParams === 'string') {
      window.open(this.router.createUrlTree([this.linkParams], { queryParams: this.queryParams }).toString(), '_blank');
    } else if (Array.isArray(this.linkParams)) {
      window.open(this.router.createUrlTree(this.linkParams, { queryParams: this.queryParams }).toString(), '_blank');
    }
  }
}
```

In your template:

```html
<a [appNewTabRouterLink]="['/some-internal-route']">Open in New Tab</a>
<a [appNewTabRouterLink]="['/another-route']" [queryParams]="{id: 123}">Open with Query Params</a>
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`@Directive`:** Defines the custom directive.  The selector `[appNewTabRouterLink]` means this directive will be applied to any element with the attribute `appNewTabRouterLink`.
*   **`@Input`:**  `linkParams` accepts the same parameters as `routerLink`.
*   **`@HostBinding`:** Automatically adds the `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attributes to the host element (the `<a>` tag).
*   **`@HostListener`:**  Listens for the `click` event on the host element.
*   The `onClick` method prevents the default navigation and uses `window.open` to open the URL in a new tab.  It uses `this.router.createUrlTree` to create the URL from the router parameters.
*   The code includes a check for modifier keys (Cmd/Ctrl, Shift, middle-click) to allow the browser to handle those cases naturally.

**Advantages:**

*   Reusable and concise. You only need to add the `appNewTabRouterLink` attribute to any link you want to open in a new tab.
*   Leverages the Angular Router to build the URL.
*   Keeps your templates clean and readable.

**Disadvantages:**

*   More complex to set up initially compared to the simple `<a>` tag approach.
*   Still relies on `window.open` under the hood, so it bypasses some of the router's navigation features (though the URL is still generated by the router).

## Security Considerations: `rel="noopener noreferrer"`

As mentioned earlier, the `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attribute is crucial for security when opening links in a new tab with `target="_blank"`. Without it, the new page has access to the `window.opener` property of the originating page, which can be exploited for malicious purposes (e.g., redirecting the originating page to a phishing site).  Always include `rel="noopener noreferrer"` whenever using `target="_blank"`. The custom directive automatically handles this, but you need to remember it for the simple `<a>` tag approach.

## Choosing the Right Method

The best method for opening links in a new tab depends on your specific requirements:

*   **Simple External Links:**  Use the standard `<a>` tag with `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"`. This is the easiest and most efficient approach.
*   **Internal Links with Router Interaction:** If you need the Angular Router to be involved (e.g., for route guards or resolvers), use the "detour" component approach or the custom router link directive.
*   **Dynamic URLs or Custom Logic:** If you need to dynamically generate the URL or perform actions before opening the tab, use the `window.open()` method within your component.
*   **Reusability and Consistency:** For a consistent approach throughout your application, use the custom router link directive.
