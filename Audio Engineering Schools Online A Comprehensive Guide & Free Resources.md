    *   **Mixing and Mastering:**  Developing the skills to balance, enhance, and finalize audio tracks for professional-quality results.
    *   **Music Theory (Optional but Recommended):** Understanding music theory can greatly enhance your ability to create and manipulate sound.
    *   **Sound Design:** Creating and manipulating sounds for film, games, and other media.
    *   **Post-Production:** Editing, mixing, and mastering audio for film and video.
    *   **Acoustics:** Understanding how sound behaves in different environments.
    *   **Live Sound Reinforcement:**  Learning how to set up and operate sound systems for live performances.
    *   **Business of Audio:** Understanding copyright, licensing, and other aspects of the audio industry.

*   **Instructors:**  Look for programs taught by experienced audio engineers with a proven track record.  Check their credentials, past projects, and teaching experience.  Many top programs will feature instructors who are working professionals, bringing real-world expertise into the classroom.

*   **Hands-on Experience:**  While online learning is inherently less hands-on than traditional schooling, the best programs incorporate practical exercises, projects, and simulations.  Look for opportunities to work with virtual mixing consoles, software instruments, and audio editing tools.  Having access to a high-quality DAW is essential.

*   **Software and Resources:**  Does the program provide access to the necessary software and resources?  Some programs may include student licenses for industry-standard DAWs or offer discounts on plugins and other tools.

*   **Community and Networking:**  A strong online community can be invaluable for learning, collaboration, and networking.  Look for programs that foster interaction between students and provide opportunities to connect with industry professionals.

*   **Accreditation (Optional but Beneficial):**  While not always essential, accreditation can provide assurance of a program's quality and credibility. Research the accrediting body to ensure its legitimacy.

*   **Cost and Payment Options:**  Online audio engineering schools vary widely in price.  Compare the costs of different programs and consider payment options and financial aid opportunities.
